# fishClassifier
In this repository, I attempted to use transfer learning from MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, with the possibility of adding more later.
and playing around the model (changing types of hidden layers, configuration, etc.)
this is like my playground for deep-learning
since the dataset is too big i will put the link of dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset
